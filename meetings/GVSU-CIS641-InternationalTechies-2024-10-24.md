Discussion points: 

* We completed almost all the tasks that were mentioned in previous discussions. Due to fall break, we held our meeting one day later.      
* This is the last week to work on the front-end development (Phase 1) as per our initial plan. Phase 2 which focuses on CSS, will begin after the backend development. We are almost done with Phase 1.    
* We decided to go with Firebase for our backend development.
* One of us will research online to find out what types of categories stores usually have and what types of items fall under each category, as we want to add a large number of item categories and item types to one of our store manager accounts (created with our credentials).   

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* **PRASHANTHI VELPULA** will work on linking the item categories page to the backend so that changes like adding or removing categories will be permanent.  
* **SAI SURENDRA KOMMINENI** will work on front-end development (Phase 1) and the item details page.  
* **VENUKESWARI OOTLA** will conduct online research.
