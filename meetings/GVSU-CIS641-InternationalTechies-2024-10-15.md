Discussion points: 

* We completed all the goals mentioned in the previous meeting and added some extra features to the login and create account pages.    
* Initially, we planned to complete the frontend first, then move to the backend, but now we've decided to work on both simultaneously. One person will focus on the backend starting this week.    
* We are preparing for tomorrow's presentation and discussing whether to use Firebase or MongoDB for the backend.  

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* **PRASHANTHI VELPULA** will work on the Backend.  
* **SAI SURENDRA KOMMINENI** will work on the item types page.  
* **VENUKESWARI OOTLA** will work on the item details page.
