Discussion points: 

* This is the last week to work on the backend and we are almost done. We have one more page that needs backend code: edit item details.   
* We would like to add some additional features such as alert messages when an item is added or deleted, as well as a "forgot password" option. 
* Starting next week we will begin Phase 2 of front-end development.         

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* **PRASHANTHI VELPULA** will work on implementing alert messages.      
* **SAI SURENDRA KOMMINENI** will work on the "forgot password" button and its backend development.      
* **VENUKESWARI OOTLA** will work on the backend for the edit item details page.
