# Introduction

Our project concept revolves around developing a web application titled **HomeGoods Inventory Management** designed exclusively for store managers. The primary function of the application is to enable store managers to efficiently manage their inventory. The application features a login page where only authorized store managers can log in, ensuring that the system remains secure. Additionally, a "Create Account" option is available for new store managers. Once logged in, managers can use the search function to browse item categories such as furniture, electronics, appliances, and home decor. These categories contain various items that the store manager can add, remove, or manage. For instance, within the "Furniture" category, items such as sofas, chairs, tables, and dining tables are available for management.

Each item category, when selected, directs to a specific page showcasing the available item types. For example, under the "Furniture" category, the types could include sofas, armchairs, coffee tables, and beds. This structured layout allows store managers to easily navigate through different item types and perform inventory-related tasks. Store managers can add new items to the inventory or remove items no longer available. Once an item type is selected,  it will be directed to a detailed page where all relevant information about the item is displayed. This includes the itemâ€™s category, name, price, description, reviews, ratings, and an image of the item. The store manager is given the flexibility to edit these details as needed, ensuring that the inventory remains up-to-date.

For the backend, we will use either **Firebase** or **MongoDB** for storing and retrieving data. Firebase provides real-time updates, while MongoDB offers flexibility and scalability. Both options ensure efficient management, allowing store managers to instantly update the inventory. The goal is to streamline operations, improve inventory control, and reduce manual effort.

# Anticipated Technologies

To build the **HomeGoods Inventory Management** web application, we will use **ReactJS** for the front end, incorporating **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for UI development. React will help manage the structure and dynamic elements of the application, such as login, item categories, and item details.

For the backend, we are considering either **Firebase or MongoDB** for storing and managing inventory data. Firebase provides real-time data handling and authentication, while MongoDB offers a flexible NoSQL database solution. We will decide on the backend as the project progresses.

Additionally, React Router will be used for navigation between pages, and other tools like Bootstrap could be used for styling.


# Method/Approach

##Our estimated plan of attack includes

**Planning and Design**
We will start by defining the project scope and requirements for the **HomeGoods Inventory Management** system. Simple layout designs will be created to plan the structure of key pages, such as the login, item categories, item types, and item details. This ensures a smooth user experience for store managers. 

**Frontend Development**
In the front-end development phase, we will use ReactJS to build the application's core components. This includes creating the login page, and pages for managing item categories, item types, and details.

**Backend Development**
For the backend, we will integrate either Firebase or MongoDB, depending on our earlier decision. The backend will handle secure login, real-time updates, and data management for item details. Store managers will be able to add, edit, or delete items, with changes reflected instantly.

**Deployment**
 After integrating the backend, we will conduct testing and finalize the project for deployment.


# Estimated Timeline

- Planning and Design (1 week)
- Frontend Development (2-3 weeks) 
- Backend Development (2 weeks) 
- Testing and Deployment(2 weeks)

Overall, the project is estimated to take around 7 to 8 weeks.


# Anticipated Problems

**Backend Selection:** Selecting between MongoDB and Firebase could be difficult.
**Data Syncing:** Maintaining the front end and backend in perfect sync can be difficult, especially if real-time updates are involved.
**Authentication:** Especially when incorporating Firebase, implementing secure authentication for store managers may provide challenges.
